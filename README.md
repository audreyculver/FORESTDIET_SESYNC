# FORESTDIET
FORESTDIET repo for the SESYNC Summer Institute 2020

This is the public GitHub managed by Rasmus and Emilie for the 2020 SESYNC Computational Summer Institute, where we will be using the skills we learn to examine panel data describing nutritional and forest-related attributes of sampled households in Tanzania.

We are two PhD students working on FORESTDIET, a project funded by the European Research Council. We seek to uncover the relationships between forest cover change and people’s dietary quality in low-income countries. The findings are expected to lay the groundwork for a shift in how we think about pathways to food security – moving from conceptualizing food security as driven by agriculture alone to seeing it as dependent on socio-ecological interactions at the forest-agriculture nexus.
